# Pygame Card Game

## About the Project

This game was developed as part of the **NSI** (Numérique et Sciences Informatiques) course in high school. It was a collaborative project, created with the help of a classmate.

# Rules of the game

Welcome to the Pygame Card Game! This is a card battle game inspired by the classic card game "Snap." In this version, you’ll face off against the computer in a series of rounds. The game has been designed to last for three rounds, with the winner being the player who wins the most rounds.

## Game Overview

- The game consists of three rounds.
- Each round, the deck is divided into three equal piles.
- The computer and the player each receive one pile.
- The player and computer each flip one card at a time. The player with the higher card wins the round and takes both cards.
- After each round, the player with the most cards wins a point.
- If there's a tie after two rounds, a third and final round will be played.
- The player who wins the most rounds is the overall winner.

## How to Play

- **Goal**: Win the most rounds out of three.
- **Cards**: Higher numbered cards win against lower ones.
- **Rounds**: Each round consists of flipping one card at a time.
- **Winning**: The player with the most cards at the end of the round wins a point.
