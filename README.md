Pygame Card Game

Welcome to the Pygame Card Game! This game is based on the card battle game, where two players compete to win rounds. In this version, there is no second player—your opponent is the computer. The game has been modified to ensure it doesn’t last indefinitely. There are three rounds, and each player has a set number of cards between rounds. The player who wins the most rounds wins the game.

How to Play

Game rules:

The deck is divided into three equal piles.
The first pile is dealt between the two players.
Each player flips one card at a time. The player with the higher card wins the cards.
The player with the most cards at the end of the round scores a point.
The second round then begins.
In case of a tie after the first two rounds, a third round will be played.
The winner is the player who wins the most rounds out of three.
